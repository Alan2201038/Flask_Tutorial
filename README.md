## Creating your first Virtual Environment (venv)

1. To create your first venv, **first create a folder** for your venv.

    ` Folder Name Exaple: Flask`

2. Afterwards, go into your terminal and make sure the **terminal directory is the same route as your folder**.

    `C:/Path/To/Flask >`

3. Next create your venv using this code. [Make sure your Python is version 3    and not Python 2]

    `> python3 -m venv venv`

    You will see a 'venv' folder being created.

    1. If you're using Windows, you can use one of these commands to go into your venv.

    **FOR CMD.EXE**

    `venv\bin\activate.bat`

    **FOR POWERSHELL**

    `venv\bin\Activate.ps1`

    2. If you're using Mac, you can enter this command in bash.

    **FOR MAC**

    `source venv\bin\activate`

Congrats! You have created your first Virtual Environment! :thumbs_up:
